Her Offering • Coffee (small, medium, large) 2.50 CHF, 3.00 CHF, 3.50 CHF • Bacon Roll 4.50 CHF • Freshly squeezed orange juice (0.25l) 3.95 CHF Extras: • Extra milk 0.30 CHF • Foamed milk 0.50 CHF • Special roast coffee 0.90 CHF Bonus Program • Charlene's idea is to attract as many regular‘s as possible to have a steady turnaround. • If a customer orders a beverage and a snack, one of the extra's is free.
